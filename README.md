# GestureVision
“HandSense is an AI-powered finger counting system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect hand landmarks in real time. By leveraging MediaPipe’s deep learning models, it translates raw camera input into meaningful gesture recognition — a foundation for future applications in sign language interpretation, human-computer interaction, and AR/VR interfaces.”
